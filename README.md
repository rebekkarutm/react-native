# React Native
Created a login page with Expo and React Native. Attempted to style with Tailwind but there were some errors I couldn't solve so resorted to using StyleSheets. You can type in the boxes, check the 'save password' box and click the login button which gives you an alert. Basic but works :)
There is a folder with screenshots of the page and how it works.

## No special requirements

## No installation required
